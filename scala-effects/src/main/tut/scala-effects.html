# Explicit Effects w/o Implicit Side-effects
### Sukant Hajra / @shajra

---

# Here is an (implicit) effect:

```tut
val printIt = println("it")
```

---

# What if these were effects too?

```tut
val twoPrintIts = List(printIt, printIt)
val fourPrintIts = twoPrintIts ++ twoPrintIts
```

Then we could work with effects as if they were simple values/data.

---

# FP makes effects values.

Beyond “programming with functions,” in FP:

* everything is a value
* values don't change once defined
* expressions can be substituted with their evaluations
* the evaluation policy affects computation, not results

---

# Scala laxly enforces principles.

In Scala, we have both

* values
* side-effects

which don't mix well; but we can tame them with:

* understanding
* discipline
* libraries like scalaz and scalaz-stream.

---

# Let's make an effect as a *value*.

```tut:silent
class Eff[A](a: => A) {
  def unsafeRun: A = a
}

object Eff { def apply[A](a: => A) = new Eff(a) }
```

Call-by-name (`=> A`) just wraps the effect in a function that takes no
arguments.

---

# We can reference effects without running them.

```tut
val eff = Eff { print("it") }
val effs = List(eff, eff)
```

`Eff` turns *implicit* side-effects into *explicit* effects.

---

# Can FP do imperative programming?

```tut:silent
class Eff[A](a: => A) {

  def unsafeRun: A = a

  def map[B](f: A => B): Eff[B] =
    new Eff[B](f(unsafeRun))

  def flatMap[B](f: A => Eff[B]): Eff[B] =
    new Eff[B](f(unsafeRun).unsafeRun)

}

object Eff { def apply[A](a: => A) = new Eff(a) }
```

This is the same `Eff` as before, but with `map` and `flatMap` methods.

---

# Let's make effects to play with.

```tut:silent
val getNum: Eff[Long] =
  Eff { System.currentTimeMillis % 10 }
```

```tut:silent
def printIt[A](a: A): Eff[Unit] =
  Eff { println(a) }
```

---

# This look imperative, right?

```tut:silent
val sillyEff: Eff[Long] =
  for {
    time <- getNum
    _ <- printIt(time)
  } yield time + 1
```

Once composed, we run it.

```tut
sillyEff.unsafeRun
```

---

# Seeing for-yield desugared may help.

```tut:silent
val sillyEffDesugar: Eff[Long] =
  getNum flatMap { time =>
    printIt(time) map { _ =>
        time + 1
    }
  }
```

```tut
sillyEffDesugar.unsafeRun
```

---

# Some notes on calling `unsafeRun`:

The type of a program is `Eff[Unit]`.

We combine effects with `flatMap` until we have one such program.

We mix in non-effects using `map`

We call `unsafeRun` only once “at the end of the world.”

Calling `unsafeRun` is a single step between
* the JVM interpretter
* our pure FP program.

---

# Scalaz's `Task` is a better `Eff`.

Here's a little setup:

```tut:silent
import scalaz.concurrent.Task

val getNumTask: Task[Long] =
  Task delay { System.currentTimeMillis % 10 }

def printTask[A](a: A): Task[Unit] =
  Task delay { print(a) }

def printlnTask[A](a: A): Task[Unit] =
  Task delay { println(a) }
```

---

# You can use `Task` like `Eff`.

```tut:silent
val sillyTask: Task[Long] =
  for {
    time <- getNumTask
    _ <- printlnTask(time)
  } yield time + 1
```

Task has both a `map` and `flatMap` method, so we get the same imperative
style.

```tut
sillyTask.run
```

---

# Here's a taste of `Task`'s features:

For convenience, we'll import some of scalaz

```tut:silent
import scalaz.std.list._
import scalaz.syntax.monad._
import scalaz.syntax.traverse._
```

so we can sequence two Tasks.

```tut:silent
def workTask[A](a: A): Task[A] =
  printTask(s"${a} ") >> Task(a)
```
The `>>` syntax sequences two Tasks, returning the value of the second task.

---

# Here's some tasks:

```tut:silent
val printTasks: List[Task[Int]] =
  List range (1,8) map workTask
```

---

# We control how we combine our tasks.

Here we sequence them:

```tut
printTasks.sequence.run
```

Here we run them in parallel:

```tut
Task.gatherUnordered(printTasks).run
```

---

# But what about Scala's `Future`?

```tut:silent
import scala.concurrent.{ Await, Future }
import scala.concurrent.duration._
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global
```

Many libraries use Scala's `Future`s for asynchronous side-effects.

---

# Just creating our `Future`s runs them in parallel.

```tut:silent
def workFuture(i: Int): Future[Int] =
  Future { println(i); i }
```

```tut
List range (1,8) map workFuture
```

We have no chance to sequence them.

```tut:invisible
Thread sleep 500  // to allow stdout to flush
```

---

# We use evaluation to sequence `Futures`.

```tut
List.range(2,6).foldLeft(workFuture(1)) { (future, next) =>
  future flatMap { _ => workFuture(next) }
}
```

One point of FP is to avoid thinking of evaluation.

---

# Also, `Future`s cache results.


```tut:silent
val getTimeFuture: Future[Long] = Future { System.currentTimeMillis }
val waitFuture: Future[Unit] = Future { Thread sleep 10 }
```

```tut:silent
val twoFutures: Future[(Long, Long)] =
  for {
    a <- getTimeFuture
    _ <- waitFuture
    b <- getTimeFuture
  } yield (a, b)
```

We get the same number twice:

```tut
Await result (twoFutures, 1 second)
```

---

# `Future` is sensitive to val/def choice

By changing `getTimeFuture` from a val to a def

```tut:silent
def getTimeFuture: Future[Long] = Future { System.currentTimeMillis }
val waitFuture: Future[Unit] = Future { Thread sleep 10 }

val twoFutures: Future[(Long, Long)] =
  for {
    a <- getTimeFuture
    _ <- waitFuture
    b <- getTimeFuture
  } yield (a, b)
```

we get different numbers back:

```tut
Await result (twoFutures, 1 second)
```

---

# scalaz-stream gives us streams of `Task`s.

```tut:silent
import scalaz.stream.Process
```

```tut:silent
val process: Process[Task, Int] =
  Process.
    iterateEval(0) { i => printTask(s"${i} ") >> Task.now(i + 1) }
```

---

# `Process` has “collections” like operations.

```tut:silent
val process: Process[Task, Int] =
  Process.
    iterateEval(0) { i => printTask(s"${i} ") >> Task.now(i + 1) }.
    take(10)
```

---

# Running a `Process` yields a `Task`

```tut:silent
val processTask: Task[Unit] =
  Process.
    iterateEval(0) { i => printTask(s"${i} ") >> Task.now(i + 1) }.
    take(10).
    run
```

which we run “at the end of the world”

```tut
processTask.run
```

---

# Of course, `Task` and `Process` do more

Both `Task` and `Process` can do resource management.

`Process`es can mix with different sinks and sources for richer dataflow.

---

# Here's some points to take away:

* “Imperative” is just a style
* FP is *great* for imperative programming
* FP allows us to freely refactor our effects
* FP allows us to freely combine our effects
