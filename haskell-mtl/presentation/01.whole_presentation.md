## For Time, Not Covered

- Monads
- Monad Transformer Basics


## Some Motivation

![An Internet Joke by Matt Parsons](images/brains.jpg)


## An Aside and (Religious?) Debate

Which one?

### A

```haskell
main = parseArgs `flatMap` runServer
```

### or B

```haskell
main = parseArgs `bind` runServer
```

### or C

```haskell
main = parseArgs >>= runServer
```

## But Seriously...

### A

The Bobolinks `emDash` begun `emDash` `newLine` Then I said softly to myself
`emDash` `newLine` `openDoubleQuotes` That must have been the Sun
`closeDoubleQuotes` `exclamationPoint`

### or B

> The Bobolinks – begun –
>
> Then I said softly to myself –
>
> “That must have been the Sun”!


## Themes

- Beyond
    - Trouble naming the highly abstract
    - Work to make the unfamiliar familiar
- You are a human being!
    - No programming langauge is "natural"
    - But there are neurological constraints
- Also
    - Make every character on the page count
    - Be wary of low-level litter in high-level statements


## Is the Naïve also Simple?

### Is there a problem with this at all?

```haskell
makeUser :: Config -> IO ()
makeUser = ...

getInsight :: Config -> IO ()
getInsight = ...

toyApp :: Config -> IO ()
toyApp = do
    user <- makeUser
    insight <- getInsight(user)
    showInsight(user, insight)
```

### Some Complaints

- `IO` lock-in
- passing around a global `Config` everywhere


## Classy Optics


### Does this help?

```haskell
makeUser
    :: HasDbConfig c
    => c -> IO ()

getInsight
    :: (HasDbConfig c, HasMetricsConfig c)
    => c -> IO ()

toyApp
    :: (HasDbConfig c, HasMetricsConfig c)
    => c -> IO ()
```

### Some Complaints

- `IO` lock-in, still


## Sometimes libraries force our hand

###

```haskell
makeUser
    :: (HasDbConfig c, MonadIO m)
    => c -> m ()

getInsight
    :: (HasDbConfig c, HasMetricsConfig c, MonadIO m)
    => c -> m ()

toyApp
    :: (HasDbConfig c, HasMetricsConfig c, MonadIO m)
    => c -> m ()
```

### Some Complaints

- It's getting kind of busy


## Is MTL worth it?

###

```haskell
makeUser
    :: (HasDbConfig c, MonadReader c m, MonadIO m)
    => m ()

getInsight
    ::  ( HasDbConfig c, HasMetricsConfig c
        , MonadReader c m, MonadIO m )
    => m ()

toyApp
    ::  ( HasDbConfig c, HasMetricsConfig c
        , MonadReader c m, MonadIO m )
    => m ()
```


## Think in terms of your domain

### Make the API you want to use!

```haskell
class MonadIO m => Db m where
    getDbConn :: m DbConn

class MonadIO m => Metric m where
    getMetricConn :: m MetricConn
```

### Call sites are simple, minimal, clear

```haskell
makeUser :: Db m => m ()

getInsight :: (Db m, Metric m) => m ()

toyApp :: (Db m, Metric m) => m ()
```

## Observations/Comments

- Parses better at a glance
- Implementations decisions are hidden/deferred
    - Classy Optics
    - MTL
    - Extensible Effects
    - Free with coproducts (with optics, if you like)
- Is there a name for this?
    - "MTL-style"
    - "finally tagless"
- Good example code
    - Katip (a Haskell logging library)
    - github.com/Soostone/katip/blob/master/katip/examples/example.hs


## We're not quite done

### We still need an implementation

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}

newtype App a =
    App { unApp :: ReaderT Config IO a }
    deriving
        ( Functor , Applicative , Monad
        , MonadIO, MonadReader Config)

instance Db App where
    getDbConn = ask >>= makeDbConn . getDbUrl

instance Metric App where
    getMetricConn = ask >>= makeMetricsConn . getMetricsUrl
```


## Teaser for a follow-up discussion

### Problems we've had with `MonadError`

- `MonadError` locks error type
- Need to call `runExceptT` to handle exceptions
    - Inconvenient with a nested stack
    - Requires intermediate error types for matching

### We've ended up with this kind of code

```haskell
toyApp :: (Db m, Metrics m) => ExceptT SomeAPIFault m ()
```

### Experimenting with a new approach

- _Explicitly Typed Exceptions for Haskell_ by Josè Iborra
- Seems promising in theory and small examples
- Want to use more at scale before recommending
