## For Time, Not Covered

- Monads
- Monad Transformer Basics
- Monad Transformer Library (MTL)
- Optics (Lenses)
- Classy Optics


## Some Motivation

![An Internet Joke by Matt Parsons](images/brains.jpg)

## Exercise 1

Which one?

### A

```haskell
parseConfig `bind` runApp
```

### B

```haskell
parseConfig >>= runApp
```

## Exercise 2
### A

The Bobolinks `emDash` begun `emDash` `newLine` Then I said softly to myself
`emDash` `newLine` `openDoubleQuotes` That must have been the Sun
`closeDoubleQuotes` `exclamationPoint`

### B

> The Bobolinks – begun –
>
> Then I said softly to myself –
>
> “That must have been the Sun”!


## Is the Naïve also Simple?

###

```haskell
makeUser :: Config -> IO ()
makeUser = ...

getInsight :: Config -> IO ()
getInsight = ...

runApp :: Config -> IO ()
runApp = do
    user <- makeUser
    insight <- getInsight(user)
    showInsight(user, insight)
```

### Complaint

passing around a global `Config` everywhere


## Classy Optics


### Does this help?

```haskell
makeUser
    :: HasDbConfig c
    => c -> IO ()

getInsight
    :: (HasDbConfig c, HasMetricsConfig c)
    => c -> IO ()
```

### Complaint

`IO` lock-in


## Sometimes libraries force our hand

###

```haskell
makeUser
    :: (HasDbConfig c, MonadIO m)
    => c -> m ()

getInsight
    :: (HasDbConfig c, HasMetricsConfig c, MonadIO m)
    => c -> m ()
```

### Some Complaints

- It's getting kind of busy


## Is MTL worth it?

###

```haskell
makeUser
    :: (HasDbConfig c, MonadReader c m, MonadIO m)
    => m ()

getInsight
    ::  ( HasDbConfig c, HasMetricsConfig c
        , MonadReader c m, MonadIO m )
    => m ()
```


## Make the API reflect how you think!
### Component-centric type classes

```haskell
class MonadIO m => Db m where
    getDbConn :: m DbConn

class Monad m => Metrics m where
    sendMetric :: Component -> Event -> m ()
```


## Say what you mean...

### No more, no less

```haskell
makeUser :: Db m => m ()

getInsight :: (Db m, Metrics m) => m ()
```

### Observations/Comments

- Parses better at a glance
- Implementations decisions are hidden/deferred


## We're not quite done

### We still need an implementation

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}

newtype App a = App { unApp :: ReaderT Config IO a }
    deriving
        ( Functor , Applicative , Monad
        , MonadIO, MonadReader Config )

instance Db App where
    getDbConn = ask >>= liftIO . libMakeDbConn . getDbUrl

instance Metrics App where
    sendMetric c s = ask >>= liftIO . libSendMetric c s
```

## This is not new

- Is there a name for this?
    - "MTL-style"
    - "finally tagless"
- Good example code
    - Katip (a Haskell logging library)
    - github.com/Soostone/katip/blob/master/katip/examples/example.hs

## Thanks

### Remember

- Maximize comprehension at a glance.
- Whitespace matters.
- Keep high-level ideas visible.

## Quick mention

# Extra Material Not Presented

## Teaser for a follow-up discussion

### Problems we've had with `MonadError`

- `MonadError` locks error type
- Need to call `runExceptT` to handle exceptions
    - Inconvenient with a nested stack
    - Requires intermediate error types for matching

### We've ended up with this kind of code

```haskell
runApp :: (Db m, Metrics m) => ExceptT SomeAPIFault m ()
```

### Experimenting with a new approach

- _Explicitly Typed Exceptions for Haskell_ by Josè Iborra
- Seems promising in theory and small examples
- Want to use more at scale before recommending
