# Something about Free Monads
### Sukant Hajra / @shajra

---

# Ways to learn about free monads

* Start with the mathematics
  * pro: wonderful insights
  * con: some people can get lost

* Start with engineering problems
  * pro: more people keep up
  * con: math can seem mysterious
  * con: an over-specialized understanding

Not losing people is important.

Let's start from the engineering side (it suits my competance anyway).

---

# A simple program

```scala
val a = Console.readLine
val b = Console.readLine
Console.println(s"${a.toUpperCase} ${b.toLowerCase}")
```

Here's a few observations:

* has side-effects
* does only one thing
* hard to test
* conjoins describing with doing

---

# The COMMAND™ Design Pattern

We can represent our program in terms of a command language:

```tut:silent
sealed trait ConsoleOp
case object ReadLine extends ConsoleOp
case class PrintLine(s: String) extends ConsoleOp
```

* But how do we combine our commands?
* Where's the type of the return value?

This *algebraic data type (ADT)* representation is inadequate.

---

# Parameterizing return types

```tut:silent
sealed trait ConsoleOp[A]
case object ReadLine extends ConsoleOp[String]
case class PrintLine(s: String) extends ConsoleOp[Unit]
```

* Now we have return types.
* It's not obvious how we compose them.

Technically, this is a Generalized Algebraic Data Type (GADT) encoding.

* GADTs in Scala are fragile.
* GADTs in Scala are another talk.

---

# Fast-forward to the punch-line

We're going to use Scalaz's `Free` to turn our `ConsoleOp` to a `ConsoleIO`:

```tut:silent
import scalaz.Free
type ConsoleIO[A] = Free.FreeC[ConsoleOp, A]
```

Then we'll lift our data constructors to `ConsoleIO`:

```tut:silent
def readLine: ConsoleIO[String] =
  Free.liftFC(ReadLine)

def printLine(l: String): ConsoleIO[Unit] =
  Free.liftFC(PrintLine(l))
```
---

# Free is a monad

Free has reasonable `map` and `flatMap` methods, so it works like this:

```tut:silent
def consoleRun: ConsoleIO[Unit] =
  for {
    a <- readLine
    b <- readLine
    _ <- printLine(s"${a.toUpperCase} ${b.toLowerCase}")
  } yield ()
```

* composing commands with functions!
* **just data** — doesn't *do* anything

---

# Reminder of desugaring

For-yield syntax turns into these calls:

```tut:silent
def consoleRun: ConsoleIO[Unit] =
  readLine flatMap { a =>
    readLine flatMap { b =>
      printLine(s"${a.toUpperCase} ${b.toLowerCase}")
         .map { _ => () }
    }
  }
```

---

# Write an interpretter

To interpret our grammar, we need a natural transformation from ConsoleOp to a
monad (we'll use `scalaz.concurrent.Task`).

```tut:silent
import scalaz.~>
import scalaz.concurrent.Task
```

Here's our natural transformation:

```tut:silent
val consoleOpToTask: ConsoleOp ~> Task =
  new (ConsoleOp ~> Task) {
    def apply[A](op: ConsoleOp[A]): Task[A] =
      op match {
        case ReadLine =>
          Task delay { Console.readLine }
        case PrintLine(line) =>
          Task delay { Console println line }
      }
  }

```

---

# Interpret

`Free` provides `runFC` to run our natural transformation:

```tut:silent
val consoleRunTask: Task[Unit] =
  Free.runFC(consoleRun)(consoleOpToTask)
```

Now we have a `Task`

* but it's still hard to test
* an effect-less interpretter may be useful

---

# An effect-less interpretter

We can use the `State` monad for testing:

```tut:silent
import scalaz.State
```

`State` is basically `S => (S, A)`

---

# Fake console state:

Here's some immutable state for testing:

```tut:silent
case class ConsoleFake(in: List[String], out: List[String]) {
    def read: (ConsoleFake, String) =
      in match {
        case (h :: t) => (copy(in=t), h)
        case _        => (this, "")
      }
    def write(msg: String): (ConsoleFake, Unit) =
      (copy(out=msg :: out), ())
}
```

---

# A testing interpretter

Now we can make a natural transformation:

```tut:silent
type ConsoleState[A] = State[ConsoleFake, A]
```

```tut:silent
val consoleOpToState: ConsoleOp ~> ConsoleState =
  new (ConsoleOp ~> ConsoleState) {
    def apply[A](op: ConsoleOp[A]): ConsoleState[A] =
      op match {
        case ReadLine => State { _.read }
        case PrintLine(line) => State { _ write line }
      }
  }
```

---

# We can run tests

Again, we can interpret our program:

```tut:silent
val consoleRunFake: State[ConsoleFake, Unit] =
  Free.runFC(consoleRun)(consoleOpToState)
```

and finally run it:

```tut
println(
  consoleRunFake.
    run(
      ConsoleFake(
        List("hElLo", "wOrLD"),
        List.empty)))
```

---

# Very different interpretters

* `Task[Unit]`
* `ConsoleFake => (ConsoleFake, Unit)`

One interpretter is effectful.

One interpretter is effect-less.

---

# You can *really* use this

* At Rackspace we orchestrated web service calls.
* At Cognitive Scale, we wrap an imperative STM library.
* Rob Norris's Doobie project abstracts over JDBC.

Rob deserves special credit; I've lifted various code snippets of his.

---

# Enough to be dangerous

* You now know the FREE™ design pattern.
* We've satisfied a host of design goals.
* Beyond some funny types, it's not much boilerplate.
* **But how does it work?!**

---

# Start with a functor

We know for our language to compose, we need both:

* `map[F[_], A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]`
* `flatMap[F[_], A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => F[B]): F[B]`

A *functor* gives us just the `map`:

```tut:silent
trait Functor[F[_]] {
  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => B): F[B]
}
```

`map` also satisfies some laws, but we won't cover them today.

---

# Yoneda lemma

The *Yoneda lemma* specializes in Scala to say:

We can write any `F[_]` in terms of `Coyoneda[_[_], _]`,
described as:

```tut:silent
trait Coyoneda[F[_], A] {
  type I
  val fi: F[I]
  def f: I => A
}
```

---

# All `F[_]`'s are `Coyoneda`s

Let's try converting any `F[_]` to `Coyoneda[_[_], _]`:

```tut:silent
// convenience constructor
def newCoyo[F[_], A, B](fa: F[A])(_f: A => B) =
  new Coyoneda[F, B] {
    type I = A
    val fi = fa
    def f = _f
  }

def liftC[F[_], A](fa: F[A]): Coyoneda[F, A] =
  newCoyo(fa)(identity)
```

We can also convert it back if it's a functor:

```tut:silent
def unliftC[F[_], A](coyo: Coyoneda[F, A])
    (implicit functor: Functor[F]): F[A] =
  functor.map(coyo.fi)(coyo.f)
```

---

# Functor for free

Note that Coyoneda is a functor for all `F[_]`:

```tut:silent
implicit def coyoFunctor[F[_]]: Functor[Coyoneda[F, ?]] =
    new Functor[Coyoneda[F, ?]] {
      def map[A, B](coyo: Coyoneda[F, A])(f: A => B)
          : Coyoneda[F, B] { type I = coyo.I }  =
        newCoyo(coyo.fi)(coyo.f andThen f)
    }
```

Thing are getting advanced:
* path-dependent types need explicit type refinement
* the "?" notation is from Erik Osheim's kind-projector plugin.

By converting our grammar to a Coyoneda, we get a functor, so we can `map`.

---

# What about `flatMap`?

We've got a free functor now.

If we had a free monad, we'd get both `map` and `flatMap`:

```tut:silent
trait Monad[F[_]] extends Functor[F] {
  def point[A](a: A): F[A]
  def flatMap[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A => F[B]): F[B]
}
```

These functions also have laws that we won't talk about today.

---

# Getting a free monad

This data structure will prove useful:

```tut:silent
sealed abstract class FreeM[F[_], A]
case class Done[F[_], A](a: A) extends FreeM[F, A]
case class More[F[_], A](next: F[FreeM[F, A]]) extends FreeM[F, A]
```

Stare at this recursive type; let it sink in.

* “Free” has a rigorous mathematical definition.
* `scalaz.Free` is one of many free structures.
* `scalaz.FreeAp` is a free applicative functor.
* For us “free” connotes a minimal necessary structure.

---

# From a functor to a monad

If we have a functor for an `F[_]`, then we get a monad for `FreeM[F, ?]`:

```tut:silent
implicit def freeMonad[F[_]]
    (implicit functor: Functor[F]): Monad[FreeM[F, ?]] =

  new Monad[FreeM[F, ?]] {

    def point[A](a: A): FreeM[F, A] = Done(a)

    def map[A, B](ffa: FreeM[F, A])(f: A => B): FreeM[F, B] =
      ffa match {
        case Done(a) => Done(f(a))
        case More(fa) => More(functor.map(fa) { map(_)(f) })
      }

    def flatMap[A, B](ffa: FreeM[F, A])(f: A => FreeM[F, B]): FreeM[F, B] =
      ffa match {
        case Done(a) => f(a)
        case More(fa) => More(functor.map(fa) { flatMap(_)(f) })
      }

  }
```

---

# What do we have thus far?

* We can turn `F[_]` into `Coyoneda[F, _]`
* `Coyoneda[F, _]` has a functor instance
* Given a functor, `FreeM` gives us a monad instance

For this type:

```tut:silent
type FreeC[F[_], A] = FreeM[Coyoneda[F, ?], A]
```

We should be able to lift a simple `F[_]` to `FreeC[F, _]`:

```scala
def liftFC[F[_], A](fa: F[A]): FreeC[F, A] = ???
```

---

# Lifting `F[_]` to `FreeC[F, _]`

Unfortunately, Scala needs an “unapply” trick to disambiguate nested types.

```tut:silent
import scalaz.Unapply

def liftF[F[_], A](fa: => F[A])
    (implicit functor: Functor[F]): FreeM[F, A] =
  More(functor.map(fa)(Done[F, A]))

def liftFU[MA](ma: => MA)
    (implicit u: Unapply[Functor, MA]): FreeM[u.M, u.A] =
  liftF(u(ma))(u.TC)
```

With `Unapply` we can finally get `liftFC`:

```tut:silent
def liftFC[F[_], A](fa: F[A]): FreeC[F, A] =
  liftFU(liftC(fa))
```

Learning more about `Unapply` is another talk.

---

# Now, the interpretter

At this point, we have `liftFC` defined so we can:

* make instances of our declarative language
* compose these instances monadically

Lastly, we need `runFC` so we can run different interpreters.

---

# Finally, runFC

```tut:silent
// Needed for type ascription
def foldFC[F[_], A, B](fa: FreeM[F, A])
    (ifDone: A => B)(ifMore: F[FreeM[F, A]] => B): B =
  fa match {
    case Done(a) => ifDone(a)
    case More(f) => ifMore(f)
  }

def runFC[F[_], G[_], A]
    (free: FreeC[F, A])(natTrans: F ~> G)
    (implicit monad: Monad[G])
    : G[A] =
    foldFC[Coyoneda[F, ?], A, G[A]](free)(monad.point) { coyo =>
      monad.flatMap(natTrans(coyo.fi)) { x =>
        runFC(coyo.f(x))(natTrans)
      }
    }
```

---

# BANG!

(This would all be more exciting if we didn't see the punch-line already.)

Here's some point to take away:

* Making small command languages is easy.
* Making different interpretters is easy.
* Interpretters don't need to share a common interface.
* Free monads separate concerns and hide complexity.
* Free monads can help build extensible systems.

---

# Next Steps

* Our `FreeM` isn't stack-safe (use `scalaz.Free`).
* Mix free grammars with something called `Coproduct`.
* Compare free grammars with other “expression problem” solutions.
* Learn work-arounds for GADTs when they fail in Scala.
